# Simple Regression Project

## Project Description
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict student marks based on the number of hours studied per week. The aim is to demonstrate the steps involved in building, training, and evaluating a regression model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 2 variables:
- **Hours per Week**: Number of hours studied each week (Independent Variable)
- **Marks Obtained**: Marks scored by the student (Dependent Variable)

## Activities Performed
1. **Data Processing**  
   - Loading the dataset  
   - Exploring and cleaning the data

2. **Train and Test Model**  
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets  
   - Training the model using Linear Regression

3. **Prediction**  
   - Making predictions on the test dataset

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy measurement using RÂ² Score  
   - Coefficient and intercept analysis  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) calculation  
   - Plotting the predictions against actual values
